## The Basics

Andy Stevens is a technical writer by day, and a poet, web developer, and tinkerer by night. Andy holds a B.A. in Creative Writing from Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, FL, and an M.F.A in Creative Writing from University of Tampa.

His poetry and writing have been published in a few places, but the internet being what it is, not all of it still exists. He is currently working on his first book-length collection. If you're a friend or family member, or an editor, and would like an advanced copy of the collection-in-progress, please reach out.
